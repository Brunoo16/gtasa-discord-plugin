A Discord Rich Presence plugin for GTA:SA.

![demo](https://i.imgur.com/AYDK30W.png)

It shows:
[Singleplayer] game icon, current weapon icon, current mission, progress (in percentage), in-game days passed(when you hover over the game icon) and current location (when you hover over the weapon icon).
[SA-MP] samp icon, current weapon icon, your nickname[id], current server, current location (when you hover over the weapon icon).

**Just like any other ASI plugin, you are gonna need an ASI loader to use this one.**
